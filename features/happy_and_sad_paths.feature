    Feature: User can add movie by searching for it in The Movie Database (TMDb)
     
      As a movie fan
      So that I can add new movies without manual tedium
      I want to add movies by looking up their details in TMDb
     
    Background: Start from the Search form on the home page
     
      Given I am on the hw3_rottenpotatoes home page
      Then I should see "Search TMDb for a movie"
     
    Scenario: Try to add nonexistent movie (sad path)
     
      When I fill in "Search Terms" with "Movie That Does Not Exist"
      And I press "Search TMDb"
      Then I should be on the hw3_rottenpotatoes home page
      And I should see "'Movie That Does Not Exist' was not found in TMDb."
     
    Scenario: Try to add existing movie (happy path)
     
      When I fill in "Search Terms" with "Inception"
      And I press "Search TMDb"
      Then I should be on the hw3_rottenpotatoes home page
      And I should see "Inception"
      And I should see "PG-13"
